# AlgCo
Algorithm Comparison (recreated old tool)



----
Enhancement under work when free time : To Do:
Visualization: Use libraries like matplotlib or plotly for side-by-side metric comparison.
Expand Metrics: Add diversity of metrics like NDCG, hit rate, etc.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use frameworks like Keras Tuner for optimizing model parameters.
Scalability: Integrate with distributed systems for handling large-scale datasets.
